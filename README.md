## 1. Executive Abstract
Predictive modeling in zero-sum environments often fails because it relies on static regression. Real-world adversarial systems (markets, competitive gaming, logistics) are governed by **Non-Linear Decay**.

**FLUX v2.0** is a dual-core simulation engine that models the tension between **Kinetic Force** (Efficiency/Power) and **Entropic Friction** (Resistance/Time). By simulating "Drift" and "Hysteresis," Flux identifies **Systemic Criticality**—the precise moment a system transitions from a stable "Grind" to a catastrophic "Snap."

## 2. System Architecture
Flux operates on a recursive feedback loop, continuously updating the system state based on the interaction between Kinetic Load and Environmental Variance.

## 3. The Physics Kernel
The engine simulates three distinct phases of systemic decay:

### Phase I: Entropic Drift (The Grind)
Systems under load do not degrade linearly; they accumulate invisible friction.
$$ D_{t+1} = D_t + (\alpha \cdot E_t) $$
*Where $D$ is Drift and $E$ is Environmental Entropy.*

### Phase II: Hysteresis (Imperfect Recovery)
Rest periods restore capacity, but never to 100%. Permanent wear ($\delta$) accumulates.
$$ S_{t+1} = S_t + R - \delta $$

### Phase III: Feedback Amplification (The Snap)
When the **Kinetic Mismatch** exceeds the **Critical Threshold (>20%)**, the system enters a failure cascade. The dominant force accelerates, while the resisting force collapses exponentially.

## 4. Operational Applications
FLUX v2.0 is domain-agnostic, designed for any environment involving adversarial stress.

### A. Competitive Game Theory (Sports & Esports)
*   **Problem:** Traditional models overvalue "Average Performance" and undervalue "Matchup Friction."
*   **Flux Solution:** Simulates the **Suffocation Protocol**. It predicts when a defensive unit (High Entropy) will completely neutralize an offensive unit (Low Kinetics), turning a projected close match into a blowout.

### B. Supply Chain Resilience
*   **Problem:** Just-in-Time (JIT) networks look efficient until a single node fails.
*   **Flux Solution:** Models **Coupled Instability**. It identifies which nodes have accumulated too much "Drift" and predicts where the chain reaction (The Snap) will occur days before the breakage.

### C. Algorithmic Market Making
*   **Problem:** Liquidity providers get run over during volatility spikes.
*   **Flux Solution:** Distinguishes between **Noise** (Reversion) and **Trend** (The Snap). If Kinetic Flow > Entropic Resistance, Flux signals a "Breakout" rather than a "Reversion," preventing costly counter-trading.

## 5. Technical Specifications
*   **Simulation Core:** Python 3.9+ (NumPy / Pandas)
*   **Logic:** Recursive State Machine (RSM)
*   **Time-Weighting:** Exponential Accumulator (Q1-Q4 Scaling)
*   **Guardrails:** Behavioral Override Logic (Scoreboard Validation)
